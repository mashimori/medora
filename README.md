# MEDORA

**MEDORA** (Mega Easy Deployment On Fedora) is my personal project for automated application installation and configuration on Fedora Linux to make life radically easier.

**We all hate the manual setup loop after a fresh install.** I wanted to create something similar to **omarchy** or **omakube**, a tool that just **works** and eliminates unnecessary boilerplate—but customized in my own way. I did my absolute best to make this solution the most robust and polished I possibly could.

Feel free to **use it, test it, and modify it**!
