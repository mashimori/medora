# <SCRIPT_NAME>.sh
#
# A brief, concise description of the script's purpose.
#

# --- Safety Settings ---
# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e
# Return the error status of the last command to exit with a non-zero status in a pipeline.
set -o pipefail

# --- Logger Import ---
# If the script uses external functions (e.g., for logging), load them here.
# The logger is located in the 'shared' directory, so the path should be relative
# to the main 'install.sh' script.
source ./shared/logger.sh

# --- Configuration and Metadata ---
# The APP_NAME is used for logging fatal errors.
APP_NAME="<APPLICATION_OR_MODULE_NAME>"
# The LOG_DISPLAY_NAME is used by the script runner to display a user-friendly
# name for the script.
LOG_DISPLAY_NAME="<Description_of_the_Action_for_Logs>"

#
# log_error_and_exit(message)
#
# This function is used to log a fatal error message and exit the script.
#
log_error_and_exit() {
    local message="$1"
    # Print the error message to stderr.
    echo "[FATAL: $APP_NAME] Error: $message" >&2
    exit 1
}

# --- 1. Dependency Check ---
# Verify that all required tools are available on the system.
# REQUIRED_COMMAND="<required_tool_name>"
# if ! command -v "$REQUIRED_COMMAND" &> /dev/null; then
#     log_error_and_exit "Dependency missing: Required utility '$REQUIRED_COMMAND' is not installed."
# fi

# --- 2. Path / Variable Setup ---
# Define and validate key paths, directories, or files.
# SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/source"
# if [ ! -d "$SOURCE_DIR" ]; then
#     log_error_and_exit "Source directory not found: $SOURCE_DIR."
# fi

# --- 3. Directory Change (if necessary) ---
# Using 'pushd'/'popd' is safer than just 'cd'.
# pushd "$SOURCE_DIR" > /dev/null || log_error_and_exit "Failed to change directory to $SOURCE_DIR."

# --- 4. Main Operation Logic ---
# The core functionality of the script goes here.

# EXAMPLE:
#
# echo "Processing..."
#

# --- 5. Cleanup / Finalization ---
# Return to the previous directory if 'pushd' was used.
# popd > /dev/null

# --- Success ---
# The script will exit with 0 if no errors occurred.
exit 0
